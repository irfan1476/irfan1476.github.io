## Step 1: Getting Your System Ready

### For macOS Users

Setting up on a Mac is smooth with the help of **Homebrew**, a package manager for macOS.

**Install Homebrew:**

If you don't have it already, open your Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
